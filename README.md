# Matrix Calculator. 
----
A simple matrix calculator using Raylib.h library to help project on to a window for a clean UI. The logic that contains inside has no reference and was all written by hand. 

# How to run.

    Download the code .zip 
    Locate: "Matrix_Test\bin\Debug\Matrix_Calculator (Application)"

## Wrong named file:

    Because raylib.h itself a quite complicated library so it requires a lot of knownledge in order to incorperate it into projects. The code that is currently running uses a sample made by a group of developers to help sorten the time that it would take to learn another completely language that would be needed to make the code run the way that it did.
    So the Application might have the different name under: "Matrix_Test\bin\Debug\game-premake-main (Application)

# Creator's note ("rant").
## note:
    - I have been doing this project for over a month now, though I have learned a lot it was quite disappointing when the rate of which we were leaning code in class was much slower compare to the project, as a result the more that we learned, we know more optimized methods of handling few situition that we wished we knew sooner.
    - I find it quite discouraging when people can apply code from already done sources. Yes it is still learning, yes it is still coding as you are (not always) required to change the code a bit to make it yours via small improvements or implementation but then again most of it were done by others anyways so what is the point when you aren't create the code yourself.
    - I am disillusion with the project at this point and only doing it not because of score but because I just want to learn code since I still find it fun and interesting but not in the way that it was present at University: stressful, helpless, confusing and annoyed.
